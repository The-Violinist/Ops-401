# Python scripts
## (plus yara and lua)

This is a repository which I created during my final Cybersecurity course at Code Fellows. 

It includes many scripts which leverage the operating system as well as implement various libraries

The libraries include:
- nmap
- Fernet
- BeautifulSoup
- smtplib
- socket
- hashlib
- pxssh
- and others
